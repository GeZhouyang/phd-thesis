\chapter{Experimental investigation of mixing in stratified turbulence}

- Define Mixing, mixing efficiency, ocean turbulence, models
- Scaling predictions
- History of simulations - expensive to reach strongly stratified regime
- Experiments to validate near-strongly stratified
- Also an exercise in open-data+open-source
