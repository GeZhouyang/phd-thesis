\chapter{Experimental investigation of mixing in stratified turbulence}

- Define Mixing, mixing efficiency, ocean turbulence, models
- Scaling predictions
- History of simulations - expensive to reach strongly stratified regime
- Experiments to validate near-strongly stratified
- Also an exercise in open-data+open-source

Thermohaline circulation is responsible for the bulk of heat transport from the
equator to the poles across the globe. Without this global conveyor belt, shown in
@fig:thermohaline-global, the average termin Earth would

circulation (AMOC) in depth and latitude coordinates. The dashed lines represent
streamlines of overturning masses, the Antarctic bottom water (AABW) and the
North Atlantic deep water (NADW), the black solid lines are the isopycnals and
the red arrow represents the downward diapycnal heat flux due to mixing. (Â©
