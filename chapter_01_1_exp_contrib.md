# FluidImage: Building a image processing framework

* matlab frameworks, dantec / lavision
* libre: no license issue to run on HPC clusters
* asynchronous processing: massive parallelization
* single tooling for entire post-experiment workflow: calibration,
  preprocessing, PIV, postprocessing of velocity fields
* limitations: algorithms
