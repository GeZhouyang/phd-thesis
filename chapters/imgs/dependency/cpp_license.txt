Foundation name and C++ logo

The “Standard C++ Foundation” name and stylized “C++” logo are trademarks of
the Standard C++ Foundation and may not be used without permission from the
Foundation. Permission is hereby granted:

    * to use the unaltered logo in conjunction with any product (including but
      not limited to a C++ compiler implementation or tool, or a product
      written using C++) or material (including but not limited to product
      packaging, documentation, educational material, user group meeting
      information, or blog post) that is related to the standardized C++
      language or working drafts thereof (including the C++ International
      Standard and related Technical Specifications, whether published or
      draft, but excluding nonstandard vendor-specific extensions), and that
      does not imply endorsement of a product or organization (including but
      not limited to that it is not being used as part of another
      organization’s logo); and
    * to use the “Standard C++ Foundation” name to refer to the Standard C++
      Foundation or to the isocpp.org website, optionally with a courtesy link
      to isocpp.org or isocpp.org/about, but not in a way that claims or
      implies affiliation with or endorsement of a product or organization.

In general, we want the logo to be used as widely as possible to indicate
material related to the portable C++ and its applications, without implicitly
endorsing something or someone. We do not normally approve modified versions of
the logo; instead, most uses should use the unmodified logo beside or near any
other art without overlap. If you would like to inquire about a use that is not
covered above, or you are not sure it is covered, please ask first.

The logo is available in various formats in the C++ logo GitHub repo.
