General Goals

In general, we want the word mark "Python" and the Python logos to be used with
minimal restriction to refer to the Python programming language.

We do not want these trademarks to be used:

    * to refer to any other programming language
    * in a way that is misleading or may imply association of unrelated modules,
      tools, documentation, or other resources with the Python programming
      language
    * in ways that confuse the community as to whether the Python programming
      language is open source and free to use

Uses that Never Require Approval

All trademarks are subject to "nominative use rules" that allow use of the
trademark to name the trademarked entity in a way that is minimal and does not
imply a sponsorship relationship with the trademark holder.

As such, stating accurately that software is written in the Python programming
language, that it is compatible with the Python programming language, or that
it contains the Python programming language, is always allowed. In those cases,
you may use the word "Python" or the unaltered logos to indicate this, without
our prior approval. This is true both for non-commercial and commercial uses.

This clause overrides other clauses of this policy. However, if you have any
doubts about your intended use of the trademarks, please contact the PSF
Trademarks Committee.
