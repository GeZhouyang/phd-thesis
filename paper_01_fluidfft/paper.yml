abstract: |
  The Python package \fluidpack{fft} provides a common Python API for performing
  Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) in sequential, in parallel and on GPU with different
  FFT libraries (FFTW, P3DFFT, PFFT, cuFFT). \fluidpack{fft} is a comprehensive FFT
  framework which allows Python users to easily and efficiently perform FFT and the
  associated tasks, such as as computing linear operators and energy spectra.
  We describe the architecture of the package composed of C++ and Cython FFT
  classes, Python ``operator'' classes and Pythran functions.
  The package supplies utilities to easily test itself and benchmark the different
  FFT solutions for a particular case and on a particular machine.
  We present a performance scaling analysis on three different computing clusters
  and a microbenchmark showing that \fluidpack{fft} is an interesting solution to
  write efficient Python applications using FFT.
