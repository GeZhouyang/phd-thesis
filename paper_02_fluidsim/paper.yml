  The Python package \fluidpack{sim} is introduced in this article as an extensible
  framework for Computational Fluid Mechanics (CFD) solvers.
  %
  It is developed as a part of \href{https://fluiddyn.readthedocs.io}{FluidDyn}
  project \citep{fluiddyn}, an effort to promote open-source and open-science
  collaboration within fluid mechanics community and intended for both educational
  as well as research purposes.
  %
  Solvers in \fluidpack{sim} are scalable, High-Performance Computing (HPC) codes
  which are powered under the hood by the rich, scientific Python ecosystem and the
  Application Programming Interfaces (API) provided by \fluidpack{dyn} and
  \fluidpack{fft} packages \citep{fluidfft}.
  %
  The present article describes the design aspects of \fluidpack{sim}, which
  includes use of Python as the main language; focus on the ease of use, reuse
  and maintenance of the code without compromising performance.
  %
  The implementation details including optimization methods, modular organization
  of features and object-oriented approach of using classes to implement solvers
  are also briefly explained.
  %
  Currently, \fluidpack{sim} includes solvers for a variety of physical problems
  using different numerical methods (including finite-difference methods).
  %
  However, this metapaper shall dwell only on the implementation and performance
  of its pseudo-spectral solvers, in particular the two- and three-dimensional
  Navier-Stokes solvers.
  %
  We investigate the performance and scalability of \fluidpack{sim} in a
  state of the art HPC cluster.
  %
  Three similar pseudo-spectral CFD codes based on Python (Dedalus, SpectralDNS) and
  Fortran (NS3D) are presented and qualitatively and quantitatively compared to
  \fluidpack{sim}.
  %
  The source code is hosted at Bitbucket as a Mercurial repository
  \href{https://bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluidsim}{bitbucket.org/fluiddyn/fluidsim}
  and the documentation generated using Sphinx can be read online at
  \href{https://fluidsim.readthedocs.io}{fluidsim.readthedocs.io}.
