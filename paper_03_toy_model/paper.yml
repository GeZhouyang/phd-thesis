  A toy model for large scale geophysical turbulence is constructed by making two
  modifications of the shallow water model. Unlike the shallow water model the toy model
  has a quadratic expression for total energy, which is the sum of Available Potential
  Energy (APE) and Kinetic Energy (KE). More importantly, in contrast to the shallow
  water model the toy model does not produce any shocks. Three numerical simulations
  with different forcing are presented and compared with the simulation of a full
  General Circulation Model (GCM).  The energy which is injected cascades in a similar
  way as  in the GCM.  First, some of the energy is converted from APE to KE at large
  scales.  The wave field is then undergoing a forward energy cascade displaying shallow
  spectra, close to $ k^{-5/3} $, for both APE and KE,  {while the vortical field either
  displays a $ k^{-3} $-spectrum or a more shallow spectrum, close to $ k^{-5/3} $,
  depending on the forcing. } In a simulation with medium forcing wave number, some of
  the energy which is converted from APE to KE is undergoing an inverse energy cascade
  which is produced by nonlinear interactions only involving the rotational component of
  the velocity field.  The inverse energy cascade builds up a vortical field at larger
  scales than the forcing scale. At these scales coherent vortices emerge with a strong
  dominance of anticyclonic vortices. The relevance of the simulation results to the
  dynamics of the atmosphere is discussed as is possible continuations of the
  investigation.
