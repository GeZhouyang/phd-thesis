abstract: |
  Strongly stratified turbulence is a possible interpretation of oceanic and
  atmospheric measurements. However, this regime has never been produced in a
  laboratory experiment because of the two conditions of very small horizontal
  Froude number $F_h$ and large buoyancy Reynolds number $\R$ which require a
  very large experimental facility. We
  present a new attempt to study strongly stratified turbulence experimentally in
  the Coriolis platform. The flow is forced by a slow periodic movement of an
  array of six vertical cylinders of 25\ cm diameter with a mesh of 75\ cm.
  Five cameras are used for 3D-2C scanned horizontal particles image velocimetry
  (PIV) and stereo 2D vertical PIV.  Five density-temperature probes are used to
  measure vertical and horizontal profiles and signals at fixed positions.
  The first preliminary results indicate that we manage to produce strongly
  stratified turbulence at very small $F_h$ and large $\R$ in a laboratory
  experiment.
